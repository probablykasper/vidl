- Fixed error when generating the default vidl config file again

## 3.3.1 - 2018 Oct 26
- Fixed error when generating the default vidl config file

## 3.3.0 - 2018 Oct 26
- Fixed config file not deleting itself when you update vidl, by storing the config file somewhere else in the OS.
- Added --config-path. Shows where the vidl config file is.
- Removed the "vidl config" command. Config file will need to be updated manually.
- Added "user_md_parser.py". This lets users parse metadata in their personally preferred way. Unfortunately, the user has to code python to take advantage of this feature.
- Deprioritized the artist and title info from youtube-dl, as I've noticed it being incorrect sometimes on YouTube, for instance for remixes.

## 3.2.1 - 2018 Oct 25
- Fixed --version

## 3.2.0 - 2018 Oct 25

## 3.0.0 - 2018 Oct 4
Basically recreated vidl 2.0.0 in Python, with some added functionality.

## 2.0.0 - 2018 Sep 25
vidl 2.0 was a short-lived bash script. Very rough around the edges.

## 1.x.x: 2017 Oct 15
vidl 1.0 was a server, website and browser extension. You used the website or browser extension to submit a URL and format to the server, and eventually you got the final thing downloaded to yourself. By far the easiest-to-use solution, but I stopped it due to not wanting the server costs.
